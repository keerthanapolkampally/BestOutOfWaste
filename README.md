 # Limitations: 
 * Due to lack of proper dataset, only the idea of recipes and kitchen leftovers could be implemented.
 * In the ingredients section, 5 ingredients are needed to be added.


# Relevance of the prototype related to the idea

The app "When in doubt don't throw it out" highlights the idea of making the best possible use of the waste that is generated around us and rendered useless usually.

This app is a prototype of the idea. It can be further extended to the following areas:

 - Kitchen leftovers can be used to create a delicious dish(as shown in the prototype).
 - How to convert waste items like icream sticks, cardboards, broomsticks into attractive craftworks.
 - Ideas to manage e-waste, recycling and reusing waste strengthening the motive of 'Swachata Abhiyan'.
 - Creative wardrobe styling ideas making using of old clothes and dresses.
